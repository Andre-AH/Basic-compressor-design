# Compressor Part Model

This repository contains a 3D model of a compressor part created in **FreeCAD**. 

## Files
- `compressor_part.FCStd` - The main FreeCAD file containing the compressor part model.
- images - rendered images of the model.


## Possible Future Improvements
- **Enhanced Detail**: Add more intricate details to represent additional small components and fastenings.
- **Assembly**: Develop a full assembly with related compressor components and casing.
- **Simulation**: Integrate basic stress analysis and airflow simulations.

## Requirements
- FreeCAD version 0.19 or later (recommended)
